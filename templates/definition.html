                    <p class="text-center">Dementia is a general term for loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. </p>

                    <p class="text-center">Dementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs after a stroke, is the second most common dementia type. But there are many other conditions that can cause symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.</p>
                    <div id="sym">
                        <h2 class="text-center">Symptoms</h2>
                        <p class="text-center">Signs and symptoms of dementia result when once-healthy neurons (nerve cells) in the brain stop working, lose connections with other brain cells, and die. While everyone loses some neurons as they age, people with dementia experience far greater loss.

                            The signs and symptoms can vary depending on the type and may include:
                            
                            Experiencing memory loss, poor judgment, and confusion
                            Difficulty speaking, understanding and expressing thoughts, or reading and writing
                            Wandering and getting lost in a familiar neighborhood
                            Trouble handling money responsibly and paying bills
                            Repeating questions
                            Using unusual words to refer to familiar objects
                            Taking longer to complete normal daily tasks
                            Losing interest in normal daily activities or events
                            Hallucinating or experiencing delusions or paranoia
                            Acting impulsively
                            Not caring about other people’s feelings
                            Losing balance and problems with movement
                            People with intellectual and developmental disabilities can also develop dementia as they age, and in these cases, recognizing their symptoms can be particularly difficult. It’s important to consider a person’s current abilities and to monitor for changes over time that could signal dementia.</p>

                    <div id="causes">
                        <h2 class="text-center">Causes</h2>
                        <p class="text-center">Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain that's damaged. Dementia can affect people differently.

                            Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common. They may be grouped by the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or by the part of the brain that's affected. Also, some diseases have symptoms like those of dementia. And some medicines can cause a reaction that includes dementia symptoms. Not getting enough of certain vitamins or minerals also can cause dementia symptoms. When this occurs, dementia symptoms may improve with treatment.</p>

                        <div id="risk-factor">
                            <h2 class="text-center">Risk Factors</h2>
                            <p class="text-center">The biggest risk factor for dementia is age. Dementia is most common in people over age 65 and the risk increases with age. While dementia is more common in older people, it is not a normal part of aging. Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells, and this damage can be caused by many different diseases. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, but there are many other known causes. Most types of dementia are nonreversible (degenerative). Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia are not reversible. There are a few types of dementia that are reversible. In many cases, there may be ways to slow the progression of dementia or improve symptoms.Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can't be changed. You can address other factors to reduce your risk.

                                Risk factors that can't be changed
                                Age. The risk of dementia rises as you age, especially after age 65. However, dementia isn't a typical part of aging. Dementia also can occur in younger people.
                                Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic changes that may increase your risk.
                                Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                        <div id="risk-change">
                            <h2 class="text-center">Risk That Can Be Changeable</h2>
                            <p class="text-center">You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia.

                                Diet and exercise. Research has found that people at higher risk of dementia who followed a healthy lifestyle lowered their risk of cognitive decline. They ate a diet that included fish, fruits, vegetables and oils. They also exercised, had cognitive training and participated in social activities. While no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates that those who follow a Mediterranean style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds have better cognitive function.
                                Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of dementia, particularly early-onset dementia.
                                Cardiovascular risk factors. These include obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and the buildup of fats in the artery walls, known as atherosclerosis. Having high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in particular, is a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Diabetes and smoking also are cardiovascular risk factors. Having diabetes can increase the risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. Smoking might increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel disease.
                                Hearing loss or vision loss that is not treated. Having hearing loss is associated with a higher risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. Research also suggests that vision loss can raise the risk of dementia, while treating vision loss can lower the risk.
                                Depression. Although not yet well understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia.
                                Air pollution. Studies in animals have indicated that air pollution particulates can speed degeneration of the nervous system. And human studies have found that air pollution exposure — particularly from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is associated with greater dementia risk.
                                Head trauma. People who've had a severe head trauma have a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease. Several large studies found that in people age 50 years or older who had a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease increased. The risk increases in people with more-severe and multiple TBIs. Some studies indicate that the risk may be greatest within the first six months to two years after the TBI.
                                Sleep symptoms. People who have sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances might be at higher risk of developing dementia.
                                Low levels of certain vitamins and nutrients. Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate can increase the risk of dementia.
                                Medicines that can worsen memory. These include sleep aids that contain diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and medicines to treat urinary urgency such as oxybutynin (Ditropan XL).
                                
                                Also limit sedatives and sleeping tablets. Talk to a health care professional about whether any of the medicines you take might make your memory worse.</p>
